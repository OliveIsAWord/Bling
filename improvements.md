Bling has made significant improvements from its estranged mother language Naglang.

- Created with Rust rather than C :3
- Function calls work on more than just identifiers, and function calls can be chained (e.g. `func(arg1)(arg2)(arg3)`)

Further improvements that hopefully will be made in future work on the language:

- Actual defined semantics (probably not a high bar to clear)
- Honest to goodness bytecode and interpreter
- IR optimizations
- WASM as a compilation target
